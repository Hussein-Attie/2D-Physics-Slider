This project contains 3 Scripts:
-PlayerController:
It allows for getting input and applying movements to the player, there's a brief explanation for every bit in the script.

-ChunkManager:
It loads and unloads chunks (or hills or tiles) to the scene, you can have a fixed chunk at the beginning, then following it are randomly chosen chunks from a list you provide it can contain any number of chunks you want and they can be of any length, please refer to this video when you want to add chunks ( https://youtu.be/_cNT0VDIuDY ). Please be sure to end all the chunks on the same height, so they can connect seamlessly. Also, there's a couple of variables you can control explanation are in the script.

-Point resetter:

It resets every object's position to 0 after a certain threshold, so the game doesnt get glichy after its played for a log time.I took it from the internet didnt write it nor edit it.
